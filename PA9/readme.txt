Description
A checkers game built in SFML, using C/C++. To play, run the .exe file contained within /PA9.

How to Play
This re-creation of Checkers is intended to be played on one machine.

1. Each player moves once per turn. Red goes first.
2. When a piece is chosen, it will be highlighted with a yellow outline.
3. To deselect a piece, press 'esc'.
4. King pieces are implemented. To 'King' a piece, the player must reach the opposite end of the board with their piece. Your King will be denoted with a yellow star.
